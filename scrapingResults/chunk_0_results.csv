According to legend, Qu Yuan , China’s first known poet , drowned in a river on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month of the Chinese calendar. Qu Yuan’s devotees searched for his body in the river and threw food in the water, accounting for the holiday’s alternate name, Poet’s Day, as well as its emphasis on boats, dumplings and dragon-related activities .

In Memoriam: Ngugi wa Thiong’o The Kenyan writer Ngugi wa Thiong’o , who was considered East Africa’s leading novelist, died Wednesday at age 87. His popular Weep Not, Child , published in 1964 under the name James Ngugi, was the first major novel in English by an East African. As he became more sensitized to the effects of colonialism in Africa, Ngugi adopted his traditional name and wrote in the Bantu language of Kenya’s Kikuyu people. His subsequent novels, including The River Between , burnished his reputation as a major force in African literature. His work often spoke truth to power, sometimes at a great personal cost: The performance of a play he coauthored, Ngaahika Ndeenda (1977; I Will Marry When I Want ) led to his detention for a year without trial by the Kenyan government. Birthdays This weekend marks the birthdays of several notable writers. The American poet Countee Cullen —a towering figure of the Harlem Renaissance —was born on May 30, 1903. Walt Whitman , whose verse collection Leaves of Grass is a landmark in American literature , was born on May 31, 1819. And Svetlana Alexievich , the Belarusian journalist and prose writer who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2015, was born on May 31, 1948.
