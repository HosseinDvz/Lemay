DigitalOcean has helped us go from architecture to launch by pairing us with strategic partners who are like-minded and innovative. Denny Darmo, Founder and CEO, Snipitz Read the case study The cost of running ScraperAPI would be 250% more on AWS, as compared to DigitalOcean. Zoltan Bettenbuk, CTO, ScraperAPI Read the case study The high availability control plane is a great addition, as it means we can be even more confident in the availability of hardware provided by you. We've never had an availability issue from DigitalOcean. Stephen Lazarionok, Co-Founder, CTO, Zingbrain AI Read the case study We soon found out that the service we received from DigitalOcean was the best in terms of stability of the Droplets and the bandwidth, and all of the network that comes out of the data centers. It's very stable. This is the key point, and that stability has helped us to increase our volume as well. Read the case study We chose DigitalOcean Kubernetes because we like simplicity. In the beginning, we had a small team and didn't have the resources to manage a Kubernetes cluster. We wanted to spend time developing the product instead of managing infrastructure.
