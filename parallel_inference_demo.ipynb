However, when running the application inside a Docker container, we cannot fully leverage the benefits of parallelism due to resource constraints—some CPU resources are reserved for container overhead. For optimal performance, the application can be run directly on my machine with more gunicorn workers and concurrent connections, which I will showcase during the demo."
