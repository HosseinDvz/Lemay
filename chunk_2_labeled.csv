Earth's 'leaking' core and strange signals from space Pandora Dewan published 31 May 25 Science news this week May 31, 2025: Our weekly roundup of the latest science in the news, as well as a few fascinating articles to keep you entertained over the weekend. 'No radio astronomy from the ground would be possible anymore': Satellite mega-swarms are blinding us to the cosmos — and a critical 'inflection point' is approaching Invisible radiation leaking out of private satellites, like SpaceX's Starlink spacecraft, is disrupting radio astronomers' ability to detect important signals from across the universe. If left unchecked, we could reach an ""inflection point"" beyond which we can no longer properly study the cosmos, researchers warn. What goes up must come down: How megaconstellations like SpaceX's Starlink network pose a grave safety threat to us on Earth Thousands of satellites with incredibly short lifetimes are being sent up into low Earth orbit. When they fall back down they're fireballs of pollution — and what doesn't burn up hits the ground. Opinion Kilimanjaro's giant groundsels: The strange plants that thrive on Africa's tallest mountain Giant groundsels are rare plants that grow up to 30 feet (9 meters) tall.

Physicists capture 'second sound' for the first time — after nearly 100 years of searching First theorized in 1938, heat's wave-like flow through superfluids, known as ""second sound"", has proven difficult to directly observe. Now, a new technique has finally done it, and could be used to study neutron stars and high-temperature superconductors. NASA plans to build a giant radio telescope on the 'dark side' of the moon. Here's why. A NASA-funded plan to build a large radio telescope on the moon's far side is nearing final approval and could become a reality by the 2030s, researchers say. The ambitious project will help safeguard astronomy from satellite ""megaconstellations"" — and help scientists unravel more of the radio spectrum. Giant 'senior citizen' sunspot on 3rd trip around the sun could break a century-old record A large sunspot has just reappeared on the sun's Earth-facing surface, almost two months after it first emerged. The unusually old dark patch remains stable and could be on course to become the longest-lived sunspot on record, experts claim. Planet Earth The closer a volcano is to erupting, the greener the trees around it look from space By Sascha Pare published 30 May 25 Scientists have found a way to monitor volcanic carbon dioxide levels — one of the first signs a volcano might be about to blow — that doesn't involve trekking up a mountain. Volcanos The land under South Africa is rising every year. We finally know why.
